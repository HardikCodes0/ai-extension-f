The restore button is a new feature that allows you to quickly recover your last operation in the AI Browser Copilot extension. It appears as an undo/restore arrow icon in the header, next to the settings button.

- Chat with the AI about a page

### Step 2: Notice the Restore Button
After the operation completes, look at the header section. You'll see a new restore button (undo arrow icon) appear next to the settings button.

### Step 3: Close and Reopen (Optional)
You can close the extension popup and reopen it later. The restore button will still be there!
