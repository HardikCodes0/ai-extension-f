# Restore Button Feature

## Overview
The restore button allows users to quickly restore their last operation in the AI Browser Copilot extension. This feature provides a convenient way to recover analysis results, research data, or chat conversations after closing and reopening the extension popup.

## Features

### Supported Operations
The restore button can restore the following operation types:

1. **Page Analysis** - Restores the last single-page analysis
   - Summary and analysis results
   - Original page content for chat functionality
   - Analysis type (summarize, extract_keywords, analyze)

2. **Tab Analysis** - Restores multi-tab analysis results
   - Overall summary of all tabs
   - Individual tab summaries
   - Grouped tabs by domain
   - Duplicate detection results

3. **Research** - Restores AI research assistant results
   - Research summary
   - Search terms used
   - Source links and snippets
   - Full research topic

4. **Chat** - Restores recent chat conversation
   - Last 10 messages in the conversation
   - Both user and assistant messages
   - Context for continuing the conversation

## User Interface

### Restore Button Location
- Located in the header section, next to the settings and refresh buttons
- Icon: Undo/restore arrow icon
- Visibility: Hidden by default, only shows when a restorable operation exists
- Hover tooltip: Shows the description of the last operation (e.g., "Restore: Page Analysis: Example Page")

### Visual Design
- Color: Gray when idle, blue when hovered
- Background: Blue highlight on hover
- Smooth transitions and animations
- Consistent with the extension's modern UI design

## How It Works

### Automatic Saving
Every time you perform one of the supported operations, the extension automatically:
1. Saves the operation type and description
2. Stores the relevant data needed to restore the operation
3. Adds a timestamp for tracking
4. Shows the restore button in the header

### Restoring an Operation
When you click the restore button:
1. The extension retrieves the last saved operation
2. Shows a loading indicator with the operation description
3. Restores the UI to display the previous results
4. Shows a success message confirming the restoration

### Data Persistence
- Operation data is stored in Chrome's local storage
- Persists across popup open/close cycles
- Survives browser restarts
- Only the most recent operation is kept (to save storage space)

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified

1. **popup.html**
   - Added restore button to the header section
   - Button is hidden by default with the `hidden` class

2. **background.js**
   - Added `saveLastOperation` message handler
   - Added `getLastOperation` message handler
   - Stores operation data in `chrome.storage.local`

3. **popup.js**
   - Added `checkLastOperation()` method to check for saved operations on init
   - Added `saveLastOperation()` method to save operations
   - Added `restoreLastOperation()` method to handle restore logic
   - Added specific restore methods for each operation type:
     - `restorePageAnalysis()`
     - `restoreTabAnalysis()`
     - `restoreResearch()`
     - `restoreChat()`
   - Updated all operation methods to call `saveLastOperation()`:
     - `displayResults()` - for page analysis
     - `displayTabAnalysis()` - for tab analysis
     - `displayResearchResults()` - for research
     - `sendChatMessage()` - for chat

### Storage Structure

```javascript
{
  lastOperation: {
    type: 'pageAnalysis' | 'tabAnalysis' | 'research' | 'chat',
    description: 'Human-readable description',
    data: {
      // Operation-specific data
    },
    timestamp: 1234567890
  }
}
```

### Example 2: Restoring Research
1. User performs research on "quantum computing"
2. User navigates away or closes popup
3. User reopens the popup
4. Restore button shows "Restore: Research: quantum computing"
5. User clicks restore

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:
- Support for multiple operation history (not just the last one)
- Operation history viewer/selector
- Auto-restore on popup open (with user preference)
- Export/import operation history
- Operation bookmarking for frequently accessed results
